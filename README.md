# Angular micro-frontend module federation (remoteEntry.js) sample with dependency injection

This repo is the least repro sample to show the dependency injection issue I am facing when the Angular app is loaded via its remoteEntry.js to the app shell.

The sample uses Angular 16.
The general approach is described in [Dynamic Module Federation with Angular](https://www.angulararchitects.io/en/blog/dynamic-module-federation-with-angular/).

## Running the sample

|            | App shell                              | Micro-frontend |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| sub-folder | [/remote_app_shell](/remote_app_shell) | [/mfe1](/mfe1) |
| serve      | cd remote_app_shell && npx ng serve    | cd mfe1 && npx ng build --project ngx-my-components && npx ng serve |
| browse     | <http://localhost:3200/>               | <http://localhost:4201/> |

Here are the steps how to reproduce this:

## App shell

```bash
npm install @angular/cli@16.2.10 -g
ng new remote_app_shell --prefix app-shell --routing --style scss
npm uninstall @angular/cli -g

cd remote_app_shell
npm install
npx ng add @angular-architects/module-federation@16.0.4 --type host --project remote_app_shell --port 3200
```

Then in the `remote_app_shell` subfolder:

```bash
npx ng serve
```

1. replace the [app.component.html](./remote_app_shell/src/app/app.component.html) `<p>Host application</p>`,
2. add `routerLink` to navigate to `/mfe1` and the router outlet.

Point your browser to <http://localhost:3200/>

## Microfrontend

```bash
npm install @angular/cli@16.2.10 -g
ng new mfe1 --prefix mfe1 --routing --style scss
npm uninstall @angular/cli -g

cd mfe1
npm install
npx ng add @angular-architects/module-federation@16.0.4 --type remote --project mfe1 --port 4201
```

Then in the `mfe1` subfolder:

```bash
npx ng serve
```

Replace the [app.component.html](./mfe1/src/app/app.component.html) `<p>Standalone Micro-frontend 1</p>` and the router outlet.

Create the module that will become the micro-frontend exposed for remote consumption:

```bash
npx ng generate module module-a --project mfe1 --routing --routing-scope Child
```

Add simple _home_ component to the module A:

```bash
npx ng generate component module-a/home --standalone --style css --project mfe1
```

Add simple _feature_ component to the module A (the one that will require dependency injection later):

```bash
npx ng generate component module-a/feature --standalone --style css --project mfe1
```

Add a router link to the Home component to navigate to the Feature component.

To test the micro-frontend as a standalone Angualar app, point your browser to <http://localhost:4201/>

## Register Micro-frontend in the App Shell

Add webpack exposes/remotes configuration. The vital configuration is spread across following files:

/mfe1/webpack.config.js -> see the `exposes` field\
/remote_app_shell .. webpack.config.js -> see the `remotes` field\
/remote_app_shell .. app-routing.module.ts -> adds the lazy-loaded mfe1 routes
/remote_app_shell .. declarations.d.ts -> declare the remote module for the tsc compiler's sake

See commit # TBD for more detail.

## Add _Hello World_ services and inject it to the component

Then in the `mfe1` subfolder:

```bash
npx ng generate service module-a/hello --project mfe1 --skip-tests
```

And add the `greet(name: string)` method.\
Inject it into the `FeatureComponent` to show _Hello, World_.

## Make the _Hello World_ service derive from an abstract service

Suppose the `FeatureComponent` could be used in different contexts with the data coming from different kinds of data sources.
The dependency injection in the Module-A could then inject the appropriate implementation of the abstract service.

Inside the `mfe1` subfolder:

```bash
npx ng generate service module-a/french.hello --project mfe1 --skip-tests
```

Make the original `HelloService` service `abstract` (both the class and the method)
and make the `BonjoursService` extend and implement it.

The protected `capitalize(name)` method in the `HelloService` is also added to demonstrate
that the service base class may provide some base capability for all the derived service (i.e. the language mutations).

## Split the MFE module to MFE and Web Component library

For re-usability, you may want to keep your (Angular) web components in a separate library project (which you could also publish as such in NPM).

Inside the `mfe1` subfolder:

```bash
npx ng generate library ngx-my-components --standalone --prefix mywc
```

Delete the component and service that was created inside `mfe1/projects/ngx-my-components` (and from the `public-api.ts`).

Instead, move the `mfe1\src\app\module-a\feature` folder to `mfe1/projects/ngx-my-components/src/lib` and export the `feature/feature.component` via the `mfe1/projects/ngx-my-components/src/public-api.ts`.

Same with the `hello.service.ts`. Move that also to `ngx-my-components/src/lib`, because the `FeatureComponent` depends on it.

Adjust the imports in the module-a files to:

```typescript
import { HelloService, FeatureComponent } from 'ngx-my-components';
```

Now you need to build the `ngx-my-components` component library before serving the `mfe1`.

```bash
npx ng build --project ngx-my-components && npx ng serve
```

This is what you should see in the standalone (left) and remote app shell (right):

## Add _Mass-communication_ service that depends on the _Hello World_ service

Let's exercise a service-to-service dependency. The `MassCommunication` service is to wrap
the capability of the `HelloService`.

Then in the `mfe1` subfolder:

```bash
npx ng generate service mass-communication --project ngx-my-components --skip-tests
```

And add the `greetAll(names: string[])` method.\
Use it in the `FeatureComponent` instead of `HelloService` to bulk greet _Alice_, _Bob_ and _Charlie_.

  NullInjectorError: No provider for HelloService!`

So the question is: Is there a way to setup the dependency injection to make it work in the module loaded into the app shell via its remoteEntry?
Or is there some additional configuration one has to do in the remote entry setup, so that the dependency injection works as expected?
